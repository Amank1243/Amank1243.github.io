## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, part 1
    This lab was very fun because I learned how fun and creative computer science can be. By using simple logic, this simple program could determine whether a car could park on a street based on a given set of rules that came from real street signs.

* Lab 9, part 1
    This lab was a very interesting one, and one of my favorites because it gave me insight to how one of the most commonly used programs, a spell checker, works. We learned how to build a basic one by storing words into vectors and checking the words with a list of words in the dictionary.

* Lab 11, part 2
    This lab was one of my favorites because we recreated the “High, low” game, using object-oriented programming. It was very fun to learn about this new style of programming which combines functions and data types together.
